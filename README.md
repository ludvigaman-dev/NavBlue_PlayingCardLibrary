# NavBlue Playing Card Library

NavBlue technical test for Ludvig Ã…man. 
Simple playing card library made with a .NET 6 Library, complemented with a demo .NET 6 console application.

## Installation

1. Open **NavBlue_PlayingCardLibrary.sln** in Visual Studio 2022
2. If necessary, set GameOfCards as startup project

## Usage

To start the demo, run the project **GameOfCards**. This will perform a simple demonstration of all created functions. 

## General information

I've created a project for the technical test in accordance to the requirements, to the extent I felt was viable within 90 minutes time. Even though I've made this project from scratch, I'd still reason that if this was a real scenario, there are heaps of premade MIT licensed libraries implementing the exact functionality requested by the technical exam. Rather than spending 90 minutes coding the projects from scratch, implementing an existing solution would be a better answer if this was a real task at hand.

## Additional thoughs

If given more time, Joker implementation, basic game sets and additional demos could've been added.
